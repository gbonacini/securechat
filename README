Securechat is a text-based client/server chat utility  that uses ssl/tls (openssl)  to establish an encrypted communication between the two parties. It wants to be a "modern" version of the talk program, the historical text chat program on Unix.
The program requires the generation of some certificates to operate. Consult the website (www.dynamiclib.com) and the man page for detailed instructions.
